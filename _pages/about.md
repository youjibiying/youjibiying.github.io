About me
======
I am an Assistant Researcher at [IDEA](https://www.idea.edu.cn/), working with [Yu Li](https://yu-li.github.io/) and Zijing Liu.
Prior to that, I received my master's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2023, co-advised by Xi Xiao and Shu-Tao Xia. 
My research interests focus on, but are not limited to graph/hypergraph neural networks and machine learning. These days I am interested in diffusion/flow models, AI4Science, and drug discovery. 
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.

<!---I was extremely fortunate to have many wonderful mentors in my graduate years. I had a wonderful research internship with [Yatao Bian](https://yataobian.com/) in [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index).--->
