About me
======
I am a Third-year master student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), co-advised by Xi Xiao and Shu-Tao Xia. 
<!---Prior to that, received my bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology in 2020. ---> 
My research interests focus on, but not limited to graph neural networks and machine learning. These days I am interested in diffusion models, optimal transport and graph generative models. 
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or my hobbies.

I was extremely fortunate to have many wonderful mentors in my graduate years. I had a wonderful research internship with [Yatao Bian](https://yataobian.com/) in [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index).
