About me
======
I am a Third-year Mater student at Tsinghua University, co-advised by Xi Xiao and Shu-tao Xia . These days I am interested in diffusion models,  graph learning and hypergraph learning. I received my bachelor's degree from South China University of Technology in 2020.

I was extremely fortunate to have many wonderful mentors in my graduate years. I had a wonderful research internship with [Yatao Bian](https://yataobian.com/) in [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index).
